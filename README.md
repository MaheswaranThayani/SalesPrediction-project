This project involves forecasting weekly sales for Star Garment Industry using a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) time series model. The sales data was collected during a field visit to the factory, providing real-world insights into the companyâ€™s weekly sales performance. After data preprocessing and exploratory analysis, the SARIMA model was applied to capture both trend and seasonality patterns in the data. The final model is used to predict sales for the next 10 weeks, helping inform production and inventory planning decisions. This project demonstrates the practical application of time series forecasting techniques in the apparel manufacturing sector
